# Simple dumb thermometer
This project is a solution for a dumb problem...

If you are a poor student, you might find yourself in a situation where you don't have any money. But! You might have an old Arduino, an OLED screen, and a DHT11/22. Then you can clone this repo and build yourself a thermo-hygrometer to figure out if you are cold because the temperature in your living quarters is too low, or if your diet is solely comprised of nuddles and Monster Energy &trade; drinks might not be good enough.
